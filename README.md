# TensorFlow Neural Network Training Example

This repository contains an example project for training a neural network using TensorFlow. The model is designed to classify images from the MNIST dataset.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

- Python (>= 3.6)
- TensorFlow
- Matplotlib

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install tensorflow matplotlib

Running the Code

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/tensorflow-neural-network-example.git
cd tensorflow-neural-network-example

Run the Jupyter Notebook to train the neural network and visualize the results:

bash

jupyter notebook

Open the NeuralNetworkTrainingExample.ipynb notebook and follow the instructions.
